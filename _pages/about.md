I am a Master's student in the <a href='https://ce.sharif.edu/'>Computer Engineering Department</a> of the <a href='https://en.sharif.edu/'>Sharif University of Technology(SUT)</a>, where I serve as a Research Assistant at the <a href='http://slpl.ce.sharif.edu/'>Speech and Language processing Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ebEhWZwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>Prof. Sameti</a>.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
