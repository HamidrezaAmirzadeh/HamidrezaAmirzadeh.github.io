I am a Master's student in the <a href='https://ce.sharif.edu/'>Computer Engineering Department</a> of the <a href='https://en.sharif.edu/'>Sharif University of Technology(SUT)</a>, where I serve as a Research Assistant at the <a href='http://slpl.ce.sharif.edu/'>Speech and Language processing Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ebEhWZwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>Prof. Sameti</a>. I am broadly interested in AI, Machine Learning, and NLP, particularly Iâ€™m interested in interpretability of the models as well as making them more transparent and trustworthy.

Before joining SUT, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at <a href='https://aut.ac.ir/en'>Tehran Polytechnic (AUT)</a>. I was an undergraduate Research Assistant in the New technologies and Robotics Lab under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xx8zwXYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>Dr. Zareinejad</a>.
